# Buster & Boo
In a house on the verge of collapse, a Ghost Hunter searches for the truth behind its curse, racing to break it before it's too late. His only goal? 
Catch the haunted ghost in time. 

But the Ghost is always one step ahead, creating traps to lead the hunter astray and trying to escape unseen. The house itself is a living entity afraid of noise. The more the noise the ghost creates, the faster the house will kick the Ghost Hunter out. 

Made for Ubisoft Gamelabs 2025, Theme - Chain Reaction.
Developed using Unity 6
