# Edgegap Unity plugin for Dedicated Servers quickstart

This plugin has been tested, and supports Unity versions 2021.2+, including all LTS releases, Unity 2023, and Unity 6.

This plugin is intended to help you:

- get started quickly with Dedicated Servers on Edgegap,
- make your server build iteration as fast as possible,
- make multiplayer development 10x easier by removing the need to learn Linux, Docker, or Cloud concepts.

This plugin does not need to be included in your builds, as it's only a development tool and does not have any runtime features.


## Next Steps

Once you have it, check for **Tools** -> **Edgegap Hosting** in Unity's top menu.

### Usage requirements

To take full advantage of our Unity plugin's build features, you will need to:

- [Create an Edgegap Free Tier account](https://app.edgegap.com/auth/register),
- [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker CLI),
- Install Unity Linux Build Support modules for Unity.

From here, we recommend following our [Unity Plugin Guide](https://docs.edgegap.com/docs/tools-and-integrations/unity-plugin-guide) to get your first dedicated server deployed.
